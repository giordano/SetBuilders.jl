# Set Description
This segment concentrates on generating detailed set descriptions. Combined
with set events, these descriptions are essential for intuitively
comprehending the reasons behind set membership outcomes in complex
situations. Using "println(describe(C))" displays the details of set C's
construction.:

```
{ x ∈ A | 0 < x < 4 }, where
    A = { x ∈ ::Integer }
∩
{ x ∈ A | 1 < x < 5 }, where
    A = { x ∈ ::Integer }
```
